# thesistemplate
A template for bachelor, master, or PhD theses based on a template by Roland Bless and on a template by Martin Kuhlemann. The template is available for theses in English and in German. Bugs and recommendations are welcome.

Migrated from bitbucket because of missing support for mercurial repos. For old issues, please have a look at the past issue tracker: https://bitbucket.org/tthuem/thesistemplate/issues
